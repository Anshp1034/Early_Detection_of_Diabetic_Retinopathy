## Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe eye disease caused by diabetes. This project aims to develop a two-stage deep convolutional neural network to screen and detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.

## Project Structure
- `Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Using A Two-Stage Deep Convolutional Neural Network Trained on An Ex.pdf`: Research paper detailing the project.
- `diabeticretino.zip`: Contains the code and data for the project.
- `Early_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy-main 2.zip`: Additional resources and data for the project.
- `FINAL YEAR PAPER IEEE FORMAT.docx`: Final year project paper in IEEE format.
- `FINAL YEAR PAPER IEEE FORMAT.pdf`: PDF version of the final year project paper.
